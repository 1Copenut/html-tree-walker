      uppermost, and bore, in the doctorâ€™s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and several
      enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had
      returned six months before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of
      disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of
      Gabriel John Utterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor
      stretched upon the carpet.
